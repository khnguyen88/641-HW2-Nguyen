## Interests

-   Photography is one of my primary interests and hobbies. I've been interested in cameras since I was a kid and owned my first one when I was eleven years old. I enjoy understanding the subject matter, composition, lighting, colors, etc. I enjoy shooting personal slice-of-life moments, but I have experimented and done urban, street, model, portraits, landscape, astro, wedding, and events photography.

-   Cooking is my other passion. It is an activity that I do at least a few times a week, out of necessity and for fun. I enjoy that you must use all of your senses in cooking, which adds complexity to the activity. It satisfies my desire for creativity and my love for science. Sometimes, it's fun treating cooking like some advanced magic system that requires balancing different elements. I recently learned how to make Country Fried Oyster and Lion Manes Mushrooms.

-   Gardening is a hobby I picked up from my parents. Growing up, my parents used to grow vegetables and flowers on our front, back, and deck. I am naturally drawn to growing vegetables because they complement my cooking interests. However, I recently started growing a few pollinator plants and flowers near my vegetable garden to help the native pollinators out. I found that the benefits of pollinator plants are that they attract bees, wasps, moths, and ants and encourage them to pollinate all of the surrounding vegetable plants, resulting in higher yields.

-   Regarding programming-related technical interests, I'd like to explore embedded design and IoT development applications and modeling/simulators of environments and systems using game engines. I want to explore embedded / IoT development applications to build practical tools and techniques around the house for my hobbies, such as gardening. I want to develop models and simulators to handle science better. Who wouldn't want to model a little ecosystem and watch how different entities interact with each other or science?

## Technical Background

-   I was a Civil Engineer with ten years of experience but decided to go back to school and pursue a Master's in Applied Computer Science at GVSU back in 2021. I successfully changed into a Software Engineer last October, and I am currently working in the Enterprise Consultant Industry, focusing on Web Application Development. I became familiar with Python, C#, SQL, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML through academia and my job. I am comfortable with and understand the basics of the Angular Framework, and I have some exposure to the React, React Native, and .NET frameworks.
