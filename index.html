            <ul>

                    Photography is one of my primary interests and hobbies. I enjoy understanding the subject matter, composition,
                    lighting, colors, etc. I mainly shoot for personal enjoyment and focus on slice-of-life moments, but I have experimented
                    and done urban, street, model, portraits, landscape, astro, wedding, and events photography in the past.

                    Cooking is my other passion. It satisfies my desire for creativity and my love for science. It is an activity that I do
                    at least a few times a week, out of necessity and for fun. I enjoy that you must use all of your senses in cooking,
                    which adds complexity to the activity. Sometimes, it's fun treating cooking like some advanced magic system that
                    requires balancing different flavors and textures. What I love about cooking, is that the good food we make often brings
                    and bond people together. Recently, I learned how to make Country Fried Oyster and Lion Manes Mushrooms, and that's been
                    a big hit at my last few cookouts.

                    Gardening is a hobby I picked up from my parents. Growing up, my parents used to grow vegetables and flowers on our
                    frontyard, backyard, and deck. I am naturally drawn to growing vegetables because it complement my cooking interests.
                    However, I recently started growing a few pollinator plants and flowers near my vegetable garden to help the native
                    pollinators out. I found that one of the benefits of these plants is that they attract and encourage bees, wasps, moths,
                    and ants to pollinate all of the surrounding vegetables near the flowers, resulting in higher yields of produces.

                    Regarding programming-related technical interests, I'd like to explore IoT development and simulator development of
                    natural environments and systems using game engines. I want to explore IoT development to build practical tools to
                    complement my hobbies, such as gardening. I want to develop models and simulations to just satisfy my love for science
                    and nature. Who wouldn't want to simulate an ecosystem of little organism battling it out for survival or planatary
                    systems?

        <h1>Technical Background</h1>
        <p>
            I was a Civil Engineer with ten years of experience but decided to go back to school and pursue a Master's in Applied
            Computer Science at GVSU back in 2021. I successfully changed into a Software Engineer last October, and I am currently
            working in the Enterprise Consultant Industry, focusing on Web Application Development. I became familiar with Python,
            C#, SQL, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML through academia and my job. I am comfortable with and understand the basics of the
            Angular Framework, and I have some exposure to the React, React Native, and .NET frameworks.
